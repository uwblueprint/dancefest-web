/*
WORKFLOW:

1. Dance event will open its registration and dancers will register for the event
2. Dance event registration closes
3. The DanceFest admins will now have a full list of the dance performances for that event
4. Using the dancefest-web application they will enter all the static dance information (eg. ID, dance title, dance style, etc)
5. Before the event, the dancefest admins will import this static data into the dancefest-android aplication to ensure they have their data before they lose internet connection at the event
6. At the event, the dance judges use the android app to enter the adjudication marks, judge notes and audio recordings (offline-first approach to writing this data back to firebase)
7. Event is finished, and the tablet regains stable internet connection again and sends new data to firebase
8. DanceFest admins can use the web app to view final results, calculate winners, etc.
